<p>Pizza David, Wirkerstr. 19, 74405 Gaildorf (hereinafter referred to as "Provider") and the contractual partners specified in Section 2 of the contract (hereinafter referred to as "Customer(s)").</p>

<h3>1. Scope</h3>

<p>1.1 In the context of the business relationship between the provider and the customer, the following general terms and conditions (hereinafter "GTC") apply exclusively in the version valid at the time the contract was concluded.</p>

<p>1.2 Agreements that deviate from these General Terms and Conditions do not become part of the contract unless they are based on a written declaration by the provider.</p>

<p>1.3 In accordance with the legal requirements of § 13 BGB, the customer is a consumer insofar as he acts as a natural person and the present legal transaction is not predominantly attributable to his commercial or independent professional activity. On the other hand, according to § 14 BGB, he is considered an entrepreneur if he acts as a legal or natural person when concluding the legal transaction in the exercise of his commercial or self-employed professional activity.</p>

<p>1.4 The provider sells self-made food, drinks, and non-food items (hereinafter "goods").</p>

<p>2.2 The representations of the provider on its website, menus, and exits on-site or printed versions of the menu for home use do not represent a binding offer by the provider within the meaning of § 145 BGB to conclude a contract, but an invitation to submit an offer. The customer offers the provider the conclusion of the contract through his order.</p>

<p>2.3 In the case of ordering via the provider's website, the customer can make a selection from the provider's range of goods and collect them in the digital shopping cart. The contents of the shopping cart can be changed as desired before the order is sent, so that input errors can be eliminated. The customer then submits a binding offer to purchase or to manufacture the products in the shopping cart by clicking the "Order with obligation to pay" button. This offer includes these terms and conditions. The provider then sends the customer an automatic e-mail in which the customer's order is listed (hereinafter "acknowledgment of receipt"). This confirmation of receipt does not constitute acceptance of the offer, but merely a confirmation of receipt of the customer's offer. The contract is only concluded with a separate declaration of acceptance by e-mail (hereinafter "order confirmation"). These GTC and the customer's order are attached to the order confirmation so that the text of the contract is accessible to the customer. These documents are stored as part of the contract while maintaining data protection. Further information on the subject of data protection can be found under the data protection declaration.</p>

<p>2.4 The conclusion of the contract outside of the electronic ordering system on the entrepreneur's website, such as orders in the pizzeria on-site or by other means, is subject to the general legal regulations.

If the supplementary performance fails, the customer can withdraw from the purchase contract, reduce the purchase price or claim damages if the defect is not insignificant. Further claims of the customer - for whatever legal reason - are excluded, unless otherwise stated below. We are not liable for damage that has not occurred to the delivery item itself; in particular, liability for lost profits or other financial losses of the customer is excluded.
